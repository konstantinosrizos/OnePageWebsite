### Single-page application !

A **single-page application** (**SPA**) is a web application or web site that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. 
This approach avoids interruption of the **user experience** between successive pages, making the application behave more like a desktop application. 
In an SPA, either all necessary code – **HTML, JavaScript,** and **CSS** – is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are **dynamically loaded** and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions.
